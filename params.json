{"name":"Scrapify","tagline":"A bunch of website scraping scripts","body":"#Scrapify\r\n\r\n**The web is full of data, but frequently not in a usable way.**\r\n\r\n**To build apps or analyze data, we need data in open-format files, not on a website in html tables...**\r\n\r\nYou'll find here some scripts to help you scrapping (extracting) data from different websites and generate csv files. Thanks to these files, you'll be able to build great things (article, data visualizations, etc.).\r\n\r\nDon't look for a awesome tool to help you to scrap website, it is not. Here you'll find some short scripts, pushed because they might help someone. We don't even ensure the quality of the code ;-)\r\n\r\n####Please participate\r\n\r\nWe can't maintain every script or keep them up-to-date. The scraped website may totally have changed their structure since the script was built. So we can't ensure that the script will work.\r\n\r\nIf you created some new script to scrape data, we will be pleased to add it to this repository to help more people.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, please create a [Pull Request][1] and we'll be very thankful for your help.\r\n\r\n####Copyrights\r\n\r\nThe content of the repository is under MIT License (please see [below][8]). To make it short, you can do whatever you want we the code. Read it, share it, modify it, eat it!\r\n\r\n**BUT**, yes there is always one :\r\n\r\nThese scripts are tools to help you scrapping data, it doesn't mean that you're allowed to do so! So please check the license of the website you are scrapping in case you want to use/publish this data.\r\n\r\nWe won't be responsible for any unlawful use of these scripts because we have lots of work to do and going to prison might slow us down :-) I'm pretty sure you may understand that!\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n#####Why csv files?\r\n\r\nWell, first csv is an open format so it should live forever. Then you can open and use csv file with almost everything.\r\n\r\n**If you are a developer:**\r\n\r\n - using [Ruby][2]\r\n - using [Python][3]\r\n - using [Node.js][4]\r\n - etc.\r\n\r\n**If you are a journalist or yet another human being:**\r\n\r\n - using [LibreOffice][5]\r\n - using Excel (but why pay when free software exists ? :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n###Websites\r\n\r\n 1. **International Centre for Prison Studies** [(http://prisonstudies.org)][6]: data about prison system around the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n###Thank you\r\n - [Marie Coussin][7] for your English corrections\r\n - [Nicolas Kayser-Bril][9] for being my SPO (Spell Check Officer)\r\n - You, if you contribute!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n###The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 AngryKatze\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
