<p><strong>The web is full of data, but frequently not in a usable way.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To build apps or analyze data, we need data in open-format files, not on a website in html tables...</strong></p>

<p>You'll find here some scripts to help you scrapping (extracting) data from different websites and generate csv files. Thanks to these files, you'll be able to build great things (article, data visualizations, etc.).</p>

<p>Don't look for a awesome tool to help you to scrap website, it is not. Here you'll find some short scripts, pushed because they might help someone. We don't even ensure the quality of the code ;-)</p>

<h4>
<a name="please-participate" class="anchor" href="#please-participate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Please participate</h4>

<p>We can't maintain every script or keep them up-to-date. The scraped website may totally have changed their structure since the script was built. So we can't ensure that the script will work.</p>

<p>If you created some new script to scrape data, we will be pleased to add it to this repository to help more people.</p>

<p>In both cases, please create a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Pull Request</a> and we'll be very thankful for your help.</p>

<p>The content of the repository is under MIT License (please see <a href="#the-mit-license-mit">below</a>). To make it short, you can do whatever you want we the code. Read it, share it, modify it, eat it!</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>, yes there is always one :</p>

<p>These scripts are tools to help you scrapping data, it doesn't mean that you're allowed to do so! So please check the license of the website you are scrapping in case you want to use/publish this data.</p>

<p>We won't be responsible for any unlawful use of these scripts because we have lots of work to do and going to prison might slow us down :-) I'm pretty sure you may understand that!</p>

<a name="why-csv-files" class="anchor" href="#why-csv-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why csv files?</h5>

<p>Well, first csv is an open format so it should live forever. Then you can open and use csv file with almost everything.</p>

<ul>
<li>using <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html">Ruby</a>
</li>
<li>using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/csv.html">Python</a>
</li>
<li>using <a href="https://github.com/wdavidw/node-csv">Node.js</a>
</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul><p><strong>If you are a journalist or yet another human being:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>using <a href="https://fr.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>
</li>
<li>using Excel (but why pay when free software exists ? :-)</li>
